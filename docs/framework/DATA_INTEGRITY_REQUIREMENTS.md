# DATA INTEGRITY REQUIREMENTS

## CRITICAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENT - NO EXCEPTIONS

This document establishes the absolute requirements for data integrity in the Semantic Document Analyzer. These requirements are **NON-NEGOTIABLE** and fundamental to the system's purpose.

## CORE PRINCIPLE: ABSOLUTE TRUTH CORRESPONDENCE

This system is built on principles which demand absolute truth correspondence at the lowest logical structure. The semantic analysis relies on the integrity of every data point to maintain logical consistency and meaningful results.

## MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS

### 1. NO MOCK DATA OF ANY KIND

**FORBIDDEN:**
- Mock metrics or placeholder numbers
- Fake data to "make the UI work"  
- Sample/example data in production interfaces
- Estimated or approximated values without explicit labeling
- Default fallback values that misrepresent system state

**REQUIRED:**
- Every displayed metric must correspond to actual system state
- All data must be retrieved from authoritative sources
- Missing data must be explicitly identified as missing

### 2. NO FALLBACK DATA SUBSTITUTION

**FORBIDDEN:**
- Showing zero when actual count is unknown
- Displaying "reasonable defaults" when real data unavailable
- Substituting cached/stale data without explicit staleness indication
- Using placeholder text that implies system functionality

**REQUIRED:**
- Hard failure when authoritative data cannot be retrieved
- Explicit error messages identifying exactly what data is missing
- System must stop operation rather than continue with false data

### 3. NO GRACEFUL DEGRADATION WITH FALSE DATA

**FORBIDDEN:**
- Continuing operation with incomplete metrics
- Providing "estimated" functionality when real functionality unavailable
- Masking system failures with fake success indicators
- Showing UI elements that imply functionality when systems are down

**REQUIRED:**
- Immediate and visible failure when data integrity compromised
- Clear indication of exactly which subsystems are non-functional
- Complete transparency about system operational state

## ENFORCEMENT EXAMPLES

### FORBIDDEN IMPLEMENTATIONS

```python
# NEVER DO THIS - DESTROYS DATA INTEGRITY
st.metric("Documents", "Ready to scan")           # Mock text
st.metric("Documents", 150)                       # Fake number
st.metric("Embeddings", "~500")                   # Approximation
st.metric("Status", "Working")                    # Fake status

# FORBIDDEN FALLBACKS
doc_count = 0 if api_error else real_count        # False zero
status = "Unknown" if error else real_status      # Misleading default
embeddings = [] if db_error else real_embeddings  # Empty fallback

# FORBIDDEN ERROR MASKING
try:
    real_data = get_real_data()
except:
    real_data = fake_placeholder_data()           # NEVER DO THIS
```

### REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATIONS

#### Option 1: Real Data or Hard Failure
```python
# CORRECT - REAL DATA OR HARD FAILURE
try:
    doc_count = database.get_actual_document_count()
    embedding_count = database.get_actual_embedding_count()
    worker_status = worker_pool.get_actual_status()
    
    st.metric("Documents", doc_count)
    st.metric("Embeddings", embedding_count)
    st.metric("Workers Active", worker_status.active_count)
    
except DatabaseConnectionError as e:
    st.error(f"SYSTEM FAILURE: Database unavailable - {e}")
    st.error("Cannot display metrics without database connection")
    st.stop()  # HARD FAILURE - STOP EXECUTION
    
except WorkerPoolError as e:
    st.error(f"SYSTEM FAILURE: Worker pool unavailable - {e}")
    st.error("Cannot display worker status without worker pool")
    st.stop()  # HARD FAILURE - STOP EXECUTION

# CORRECT ERROR HANDLING
if not api_client.health_check():
    st.error("SYSTEM FAILURE: Internal API not responding")
    st.error("Start the application with: python app.py")
    st.error("All functionality unavailable until API is running")
    st.stop()  # COMPLETE FAILURE - DO NOT CONTINUE
```

#### Option 2: TODO Comment + Hard Failure Pattern (APPROVED)
For unimplemented functionality that would require mock data, use this pattern:

```python
# CORRECT - TODO + HARD FAILURE FOR UNIMPLEMENTED FEATURES
async def compute_similarities(self, content_hashes: List[str]) -> int:
    """Compute similarities between documents."""
    try:
        # TODO: IMPLEMENT REAL SIMILARITY COMPUTATION
        # This method requires:
        # 1. Retrieving actual embeddings from ChromaDB for each document
        # 2. Computing cosine similarity between embedding vectors  
        # 3. Storing only relationships above threshold
        #
        # Current status: NOT IMPLEMENTED - Hard failure below
        
        raise NotImplementedError(
            "Similarity computation not implemented. "
            "This method requires retrieving embeddings from ChromaDB and computing cosine similarity. "
            "Cannot proceed with fake similarity scores as this violates data integrity requirements."
        )
        
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error computing similarities: {e}")
        raise  # Re-raise to ensure hard failure

# CORRECT - API ENDPOINT WITH HARD FAILURE
@app.post("/similarities/compute")
async def compute_similarities():
    """Compute similarities for all documents."""
    try:
        # TODO: IMPLEMENT SIMILARITY COMPUTATION ENDPOINT
        # This endpoint requires:
        # 1. Retrieving all document content hashes from database
        # 2. Calling document_service.compute_similarities() with real implementation
        # 3. Returning actual computed similarity count
        #
        # Current status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
        
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=501, 
            detail="Similarity computation not implemented. "
                   "This endpoint requires real similarity computation implementation. "
                   "Cannot return fake similarity counts as this violates data integrity requirements."
        )
```

#### TODO Comment + Hard Failure Guidelines:

**WHEN TO USE:**
- Feature is required for system architecture but not yet implemented
- Implementation would require significant development effort
- Mock data would be needed to provide fake functionality

**REQUIRED ELEMENTS:**
1. **Clear TODO comment** describing exactly what needs to be implemented
2. **Hard failure** (NotImplementedError, HTTPException 501, st.stop())
3. **Explicit reference** to data integrity requirements in error message
4. **No mock data** or placeholder values that could be mistaken for real data

**BENEFITS:**
- Maintains data integrity while allowing development progress
- Clear documentation of what needs to be implemented
- Immediate failure when unimplemented features are accessed
- No risk of fake data contaminating the system
```

## RATIONALE: WHY THIS IS CRITICAL

### Framework Foundation

This framework operates on the principle that semantic analysis requires absolute logical consistency. Every false data point introduces:

1. **Semantic Contamination**: False relationships that corrupt analysis results
2. **Logical Inconsistency**: Contradictions that invalidate reasoning chains  
3. **Reality Disconnect**: Loss of correspondence between system state and display
4. **Framework Violation**: Direct contradiction of the framework's logical architecture

### System Integrity

Mock data doesn't just "look wrong" - it actively destroys the system's purpose:

- **Embeddings based on false document counts** produce meaningless similarity scores
- **Cluster analysis with fake metrics** generates invalid organizational recommendations  
- **Cross-reference mapping with placeholder data** creates false relationship networks
- **Performance optimization using mock worker status** leads to resource misallocation

### Trust and Verification

The system must be verifiable at every level:

- Every displayed number must be auditable to its source
- Every metric must correspond to measurable system state
- Every status indicator must reflect actual operational reality
- Every analysis result must be traceable to real input data

## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### Before Any Data Display
- [ ] Verify data source is authoritative (database, API, worker pool)
- [ ] Implement hard failure path if data unavailable
- [ ] Test failure scenarios to ensure proper error handling
- [ ] Confirm no fallback values can be mistaken for real data

### For Unimplemented Features
- [ ] Use TODO comment + hard failure pattern instead of mock data
- [ ] Include specific implementation requirements in TODO comment
- [ ] Reference data integrity requirements in error message
- [ ] Use appropriate error type (NotImplementedError, HTTPException 501, st.stop())
- [ ] Ensure error clearly explains what functionality is missing

### Code Review Requirements
- [ ] Search codebase for any hardcoded numbers that might be fake
- [ ] Verify all metrics come from actual system queries
- [ ] Confirm all error cases result in explicit failure
- [ ] Check that no UI elements imply functionality when systems are down

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test with database disconnected - should fail hard
- [ ] Test with API unavailable - should fail hard  
- [ ] Test with worker pool offline - should fail hard
- [ ] Test with partial system failures - should fail hard on affected components

## VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

ANY violation of these requirements renders the entire system useless for semantic analysis. This is not hyperbole - mock data fundamentally corrupts the semantic foundation that makes the analysis meaningful.

**If mock data is discovered:**
1. **Immediate removal** - Delete the code containing mock data
2. **Replace with hard failure** - System must fail explicitly when real data unavailable
3. **Verify integrity** - Check entire codebase for similar violations
4. **Test failure paths** - Ensure all error conditions properly halt operation

## SUMMARY

Every data point displayed to users must represent actual, verifiable, real-time system state. When real data is unavailable, the system must fail completely and explicitly rather than substitute false information.

This requirement is fundamental to maintaining the logical integrity that makes semantic document analysis meaningful within this framework.
