# Development Journal

This directory contains daily technical notes capturing development decisions, architectural changes, debugging insights, and lessons learned during framework development.

## Purpose

Unlike traditional changelogs, these development journals focus on:
- **Technical context** - Why changes were made, not just what changed
- **Debugging insights** - Solutions to problems that may recur
- **Architecture decisions** - Reasoning behind design choices
- **Hidden dependencies** - Changes that may affect other parts of the system
- **Future maintenance notes** - Hints for handling similar issues later

## Format

Each file follows the pattern `YYYY-MM-DD.md` and includes:
- Session summary and main accomplishments
- Detailed technical changes with file locations
- Debugging patterns and solutions
- Architecture decisions and reasoning
- Future maintenance considerations
- Issues to watch for

## Search Tips

When debugging or making changes:
1. **Search by error message** - Journal entries include specific error text
2. **Search by file path** - Technical changes list modified files
3. **Search by architectural term** - "Phase 1", "Pydantic", "database session", etc.
4. **Check recent entries** - Similar issues often cluster in time
