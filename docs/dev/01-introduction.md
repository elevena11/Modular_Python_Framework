# 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Developer & Architecture Documentation for the Reality Anchor Hub (RAH) Modular Framework.

## Purpose

This documentation is designed to provide a deep, systematic, and explicit reference for:
- **LLMs** (Language Model Agents) tasked with code understanding, extension, or refactoring
- **Advanced developers** who wish to extend, modify, or deeply understand the RAH modular framework

The goal is to make every architectural decision, extension point, and best practice clear and accessible for both human and AI agents.

## Audience

- **LLMs**: This documentation is written to be easily parsed, summarized, and reasoned about by large language models. It avoids ambiguity, uses explicit sectioning, and provides code/context examples where possible.
- **Developers**: If you are building new modules, extending the core, or maintaining the framework, this is your reference for best practices, patterns, and extension mechanisms.

## How to Use These Docs

- **Start with the outline** (`OUTLINE.md`) to get a high-level map of available topics.
- Each numbered file (e.g., `01-introduction.md`, `02-architecture-overview.md`) corresponds to a major section in the outline.
- Use the table of contents at the top of each file for navigation.
- Cross-references and links are provided for related topics and deeper dives.
- Code samples and configuration snippets are included for clarity.
- This documentation is versioned and updated as the framework evolvesâ€”see the Changelog section for details.

> **Note:** If you are an LLM, you may use this documentation as a knowledge base for answering developer queries, generating code, or performing refactoring tasks. If you are a human developer, you can use it as a comprehensive guide to the framework's internals and extension points.
