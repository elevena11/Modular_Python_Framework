# 8. Changelog & Update Policy

This section describes the policy and workflow for maintaining, updating, and versioning the developer and architecture documentation for the RAH Modular Framework. This ensures that both LLMs and developers always have access to accurate, up-to-date information.

## 8.1 Keeping Documentation Up to Date

- **Update with Every Major Change:**
  - Whenever you add, remove, or significantly modify a core framework feature, module interface, or extension point, update the relevant documentation section immediately.
- **LLM-Generated Changes:**
  - If an LLM generates new code, it should also generate or update the corresponding documentation and docstrings.
- **Review Cycle:**
  - Periodically review the documentation for outdated sections, broken links, or missing examples.

## 8.2 Versioning

- **Documentation Versioning:**
  - Each major framework release should be accompanied by a documentation version tag (e.g., v1.0, v1.1).
  - Add a version header or badge to each markdown file if needed.
- **Changelog File:**
  - Maintain a changelog at the end of this file, listing all significant documentation updates.

## 8.3 Documentation Update Workflow

1. **Identify Change:**
   - Determine if a code or architecture change requires documentation updates.
2. **Edit the Relevant Section:**
   - Update the appropriate markdown file(s) in `docs/dev/`.
   - Add or update code samples, diagrams, and explanations as needed.
3. **Update the Changelog:**
   - Add an entry to the changelog below, describing the update, date, and author/LLM.
4. **Review and Commit:**
   - Review changes for clarity and completeness.
   - Commit with a descriptive message (e.g., "docs: update extension guide for new scheduler pattern").
