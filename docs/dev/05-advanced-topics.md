# 5. Advanced Topics

This section explores advanced extension and integration techniques for the RAH Modular Framework. These topics are especially relevant for LLMs and developers building complex modules or optimizing the framework.

## 5.1 Custom Initialization Hooks

- **Purpose:** Run custom logic during module startup or shutdown.
- **How it works:**
  - Modules can register post-initialization hooks (executed after all modules are loaded).
  - Hooks can be prioritized and have dependencies on other hooks.
- **Example:**
    ```python
    def my_post_init_hook(app_context):
        # Custom setup logic
        ...
    app_context.register_post_init_hook('my_hook', my_post_init_hook, priority=50, dependencies=['other_hook'])
    ```
- **Use Cases:**
  - Delayed resource allocation
  - Cross-module coordination
  - Dynamic configuration

## 5.2 Dependency Management Between Modules

- **Purpose:** Ensure modules are initialized in the correct order and can safely depend on each other.
- **How it works:**
  - Declare dependencies in `manifest.json`.
  - The Module Loader resolves dependencies and determines initialization order.
  - Use dependency injection to access services from other modules.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Avoid circular dependencies.
  - Use explicit dependency declarations and service interfaces.

## 5.3 Performance & Async Patterns

- **Purpose:** Optimize for I/O-bound operations and high concurrency.
- **How it works:**
  - Use async/await for all I/O operations (database, network, file system).
  - Leverage the core scheduler for background and periodic tasks.
  - Profile and monitor critical paths for bottlenecks.
- **Example:**
    ```python
    async def fetch_data():
        ... # Async I/O
    ```
- **Tips:**
  - Minimize blocking operations in async code.
  - Use connection pooling for databases.
  - Batch operations where possible.

## 5.4 Debugging & Tracing

- **Purpose:** Facilitate troubleshooting and observability.
- **How it works:**
  - Use the core logging system for structured logs.
  - Add trace-level logs for complex flows or debugging.
  - Use provided development tools for live reload, test scaffolding, and compliance checking.
- **Example:**
    ```python
    import logging
    logger = logging.getLogger('my_module')
    logger.debug('Debug info')
    logger.info('Operational info')
    logger.error('Error details')
    ```
- **LLM Note:**
  - When generating code, include debug logs for new features or complex logic.

## 5.5 LLM-Specific Integration Patterns

- **Purpose:** Enable LLMs to reason about, extend, or refactor the framework autonomously.
- **How it works:**
  - All extension points and APIs are documented with explicit contracts and examples.
  - LLMs can use this documentation as a knowledge base for code generation, refactoring, or answering developer queries.
- **Best Practices for LLMs:**
  - Always check for explicit extension points before modifying core logic.
  - Use provided patterns and interfaces for new features.
  - Document all changes and new APIs for future LLMs and developers.
